# Object-Oriented-Programming
object oriented programming project, Arkanoid game
In this project I used the basic Java classes, the class of graphicâ€™s in Java GIU, interfaces, abstracts classes, and decorative patterns.
The frame rate in the game was 60 frames per second in order to have a smooth flow of the ball.
